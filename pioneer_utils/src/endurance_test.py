""" nav_test.py - Version 0.1 2012-01-10

    Command a robot to move autonomously among a number of goal locations defined in the map frame.
    On each round, select a new random sequence of locations, then attempt to move to each location
    in succession.  Keep track of success rate, time elapsed, and total distance traveled.
